It is quite easy to submit via git, run these commands in sequence:

    git init

    git remote add origin https://github.com/me50/RandoG-12

    git checkout -b <BRANCH_TO_SUBMIT>

    git add .

    git commit -m "random message"

    git push -u origin <BRANCH_TO_SUBMIT>

this should do it... all of the info in <> are either in the HOW TO SUBMIT portion or your me50 repository in github.
